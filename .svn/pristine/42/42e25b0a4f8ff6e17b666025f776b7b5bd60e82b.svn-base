		Course Description
	</div>
	<div>
		More than 300 years ago in France, a man in his early thirties decided to give up all wealth and ambition to lead a band of poor and unskilled men in the religious and practical  education  of the children of the poor. Today, the quality schools run by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools that this man founded are in 85 countries. That man was St. John Baptist de la Salle, and this course is an introduction to his life and to the Lasallian and Gospel values of faith, zeal, and love, especially for one's community and for the poor.
