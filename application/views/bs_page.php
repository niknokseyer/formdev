		<p>The primary formation mechanism of FORMDEV is the weekly FORMDEV Bible study, which every FORMDEV faci must attend. Ideally, a Bible study group should only have 6-7 members, including a Bible study leader and a faculty faci.</p>
		<p>Faci applicants may also attend the FORMDEV Bible study meetings. Facis may invite their friends, too. When the number of  regular  attendees of a Bible study meeting reaches 12, it is time to split the group into two groups.</p>
		<p>A Bible study meeting begins with fellowship over snacks. If a worship leader is around, two songs of worship are sung after the fellowship meal. The Bible study proper begins with a prayer after the worship singing. During the Bible study proper, the members first read two chapters of a Bible book and then the Bible study leader explains the main message(s) and other important points of the chapters. Each member then tells the group the passage that struck him/her, gives the principle behind the passage, explains why this passage stood out among all the other verses, and shares how he/she will apply this passage within or throughout the next seven days. The meeting then ends with a prayer.</p>
